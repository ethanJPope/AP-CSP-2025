IDEA: A roguelike where you use office supplies and arts / crafts supplies to progress

WEAPON IDEAS:
- Pencils
  - Have durability (bluntness), become more blunt when you attack and draw with them, but it costs durability
- Mechanical Pencils
  - Don't need to be sharpened, but break faster. Do more damage when you attack with them.
- Pens
  - Use them to draw walls and stuff
  - Use some ink to do damage and leave a lasting poison effect
  - Break the pen to do an AOE damage with poison
      - Buy new pen at resting spots
- Paper Ninja Stars
  - When thrown, they give paper cuts
    - Take more damage if they have paper cuts
- Whiteout
  - Can erase pen lines
 
LOCATION IDEAS:
- Notebook
  - Acts as each "split" of each run. "turning a page" is changing the level, and each notebook ends with a different boss. Ideally, each notebook is a subject with new items and/or enemies in each. We'll see.
- Resting Spots (Probably called like, break rooms or smth? Idk yet)
  - Every 5-10 pages (Probably)
  - Can re-sharpen pencils, buy new ink cartridges and other supplies
    - Let the player heal? What would their HP even be? A number might be kinda boring, maybe some equivalent of hollow knight masks or smth.
- Offices
  - Properly designed rooms / chambers where boss fights happen
  - Fight different office items like big thumbtack or smth
